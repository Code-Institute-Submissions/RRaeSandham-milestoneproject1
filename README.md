# Rug Smugglers Company Website

[**__Link to deployed site__**](https://raesandham.github.io/milestoneproject1/)

## Description
This project is a webpage for a rug making company, featuring a home page, about page, contact page, and gallery page. It's purpose is to encourage visitors to interact and possibly purchase our services. I'm hoping for the page to be catchy and simple to use.

# Colours

## Typography
Used a website called [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) to select a font which is simple and stands out.



* [Bebas Neue](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Bebas+Neue?query=neu)

I chose this font because it's clear and bold. It's a sans-serif font which I think is ideal for a bold navbar.

### Design Principles
My design focuses on bold, eye catching colours, and ease of navigation to ensure a positive user experience. I am hoping to create a page that is enticing and informative also being very simple and clear to use for anyones degree of computer knowledge.

### Visual Design
I've chosen a bold and colourful design aesthetic, with a reoccuring colour palette to complement the company's branding showcasing creativity and individuality. Large, high-quality images are used throughout the website to showcase the beauty and craftsmanship of the company's rugs.

### Navigation
The navigation menu is locked at the top of each page, providing easy access to all sections of the website. I've ensured consistent navigation elements and layouts across pages to help users feel comfortable and confident as they explore the site. With each page being linked to the other for easy navigation and consistency.

### Accessibility
I've added code so that the website is accesible for all devices and screen sizes, automatically adjusting to suit the users need.

- [Responsive](./assets/readmeimages/responsive.png)


### Testing
I've tested our website across multiple browsers and devices using developer tools to identify and address any usability issues or bugs. I've also gathered feedback from real users (friends and family) to validate our design decisions and ensure that the website meets their needs and expectations.

I have added a gallery page so that potential customers can see the work that we have already done.
