### Design Principles
My design focuses on bold, eye catching colours, and ease of navigation to ensure a positive user experience. I am hoping to create a page that is enticing and informative also being very simple and clear to use for anyones degree of computer knowledge.

### Visual Design
I've chosen a bold and colourful design aesthetic, with a reoccuring colour palette to complement the company's branding showcasing creativity and individuality. Large, high-quality images are used throughout the website to showcase the beauty and craftsmanship of the company's rugs.

### Navigation
The navigation menu is locked at the top of each page, providing easy access to all sections of the website. I've ensured consistent navigation elements and layouts across pages to help users feel comfortable and confident as they explore the site. With each page being linked to the other for easy navigation and consistency.

### Accessibility
I've added code so that the website is accesible for all devices and screen sizes, automatically adjusting to suit the users need.


### Testing
I've tested our website across multiple browsers and devices using developer tools to identify and address any usability issues or bugs. I've also gathered feedback from real users (friends and family) to validate our design decisions and ensure that the website meets their needs and expectations.
